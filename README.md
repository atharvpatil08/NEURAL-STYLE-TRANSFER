# TASK DESCRIPTION:
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to apply the artistic style of one image (style image) onto another image (content image). The content and style images are loaded, resized, and processed using TensorFlow operations. The style transfer is performed using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub (arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256), which blends the style features of the style image with the content of the content image. The resulting stylized image is saved and displayed. This technique allows for creating unique artwork by merging the content and style of two distinct images.
